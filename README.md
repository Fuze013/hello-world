# hello-world
This is where my ideas will initially flow.
Before this, I didn't really have anything to motivate me move on, but now I have to prove myself to many different people, including the person I need to AND want to take care of, and myself of course.  Typically, there are many things that I can learn about when it comes to the world of coding, but I believe that I am ready to focus and apply myself to learn different languages, and expand my horizon when it comes to these things.  I will try to make it a habit to do this every single day.
